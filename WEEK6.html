												<h3>What is a 'fully digital enterprise'? </h3>
											</header>
											<p>A fully digital enterprise refers to an organization that extensively utilizes digital technologies, such as the internet, cloud computing, big data analytics, artificial intelligence, and other digital tools, across its entire value chain. It means that the organization's core operations, processes, and interactions are predominantly conducted in a digital format, with minimal reliance on physical, paper-based systems.</p>

												<h3>What are the cyber Security challenges/concerns with a fully digital enterprise? </h3>
											</header>
											<p>With the increasing adoption of digital technologies, fully digital enterprises face several cybersecurity challenges and concerns. These may include:
<br>
a) Data breaches: The digital economy generates vast amounts of data, and protecting this data from unauthorized access, theft, or exposure becomes a significant concern. Data breaches can result in reputational damage, financial losses, and legal consequences.
<br>
b) Cyberattacks: Fully digital enterprises are potential targets for various types of cyberattacks, such as malware, ransomware, phishing, or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. These attacks can disrupt operations, compromise sensitive information, and lead to financial losses.
<br>
c) Insider threats: Digital enterprises need to address the risk of insider threats, where employees or other authorized individuals misuse their access privileges to steal or manipulate data, disrupt operations, or compromise security.
<br>
d) Compliance and regulations: Fully digital enterprises often operate across international boundaries, necessitating compliance with data protection and privacy regulations in multiple jurisdictions. Compliance challenges can arise due to differences in laws, regulations, and standards..</p>

												<h3>What are the cyber security challenges for a bricks and mortar SME wanting to become a digital enterprise?</h3>
											</header>
											<p>A traditional bricks and mortar small and medium enterprise (SME) transitioning to a fully digital enterprise faces specific cybersecurity challenges, including:
<br>												
a) Limited resources and expertise: SMEs typically have limited resources, both financial and human, to invest in robust cybersecurity measures. They may lack the necessary expertise to implement and maintain effective security practices.
<br>
b) Legacy systems: Many SMEs have outdated or legacy systems that may be more vulnerable to cyber threats. Integrating new digital technologies while ensuring the security of existing systems can be challenging.
<br>
c) Awareness and training: Employees of bricks and mortar SMEs may not have a strong background in digital security. Providing adequate training and awareness programs to address cybersecurity risks and best practices becomes crucial.
<br>
d) Supply chain risks: As SMEs engage in digital operations, they often rely on third-party vendors and partners, which introduces additional security risks. Ensuring the security of the extended digital supply chain becomes essential..</p>
