												<h3>QUESTION 3</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Wireshark is a popular network protocol analyzer that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for capturing and analyzing network traffic. It allows users to apply filters to capture specific types of traffic, such as packets using a specific protocol or originating from a specific source.

Wireshark also offers features to reassemble TCP, UDP, and HTTP streams, which is useful for analyzing data exchanged over these protocols. This allows you to view the complete content of network streams and better understand the communication between different entities.

Additionally, Wireshark provides search capabilities that enable you to search through captured packets for specific information. You can search for particular protocol headers, payload content, source/destination IP addresses, ports, and more. This helps in locating specific packets or analyzing specific aspects of network traffic.

By utilizing Wireshark's features, network administrators and security analysts can effectively analyze network traffic, detect anomalies, identify potential attacks, and troubleshoot network issues.

												<h3>QUESTION 4</h3>
											</header>
											<p>In this question uploading the trojan horse similar to VirusTotal <br>
												VirusTotal is an online service that provides a platform for scanning files and URLs for potential malware and viruses. It is commonly used by individuals and organizations to check the safety and integrity of files before downloading or executing them.

Virustotal aggregates numerous antivirus engines and other security tools to analyze the uploaded files or URLs. When you visit the website, you can upload a file from your computer or enter a URL for analysis. The uploaded file or URL is then scanned using various antivirus engines and security tools to detect any potential threats.

The results of the analysis are presented in a report, which includes information such as the number of antivirus engines that detected the file as malicious, the names of the detected threats, and additional details about the file's behavior or characteristics. This report can help users assess the safety of a file or URL and make informed decisions about whether to proceed with the download or execution.

Virustotal is a valuable resource for individuals and organizations to check the reputation of files and URLs and ensure they are not inadvertently exposing themselves to malware or viruses. <br>
												If you were to upload a trojan horse or any other form of malware to VirusTotal or any similar service, several things would likely happen:<br>
												 VirusTotal uses multiple antivirus engines to analyze files and URLs. When you upload a trojan horse, these antivirus engines would likely detect the presence of malware within the file.<br>
												 VirusTotal may share the uploaded sample with its antivirus partners to enhance their detection capabilities. <br>
												uploading malware to VirusTotal or any other service is unethical and illegal in most jurisdictions.<br>
												It's important to note that uploading malware to VirusTotal or similar services should never be attempted. These services are designed to analyze potentially malicious files for legitimate security purposes, not for distributing or testing malware. Instead, if you suspect you have a trojan or other malware on your system, it is recommended to use reputable antivirus software to scan and remove any threats.
