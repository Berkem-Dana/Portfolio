										<h2>I'm Berkem</h2>
									</header>
									<p>My name is Berkem Dana, I am a 3rd year IT student, I am 22 years old.
									I was born on December 23, 2000 in Cyprus, Famagusta.My mother's name is Kezban, my father's name is Kemal Deniz
                                                                        I have an older sister and a twin brother.
									After finishing primary school in Gazi Primary School, I started doÄŸa college for secondary school. After 3 years here, I transferred to namik kemal high school in high school and completed high school here.
the university is very complicated, I couldn't decide which department I want to study and I found myself in computer engineering, it was obvious from the first day that this department was the wrong department for me, but after 2 years there, I decided to change the department and I moved to the IT department in order not to lose too many years and I am quite happy here.</p>

												<h3>This is my ITEC442 journey</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Although the Itec442 journey may seem scary at first, this term has turned into the course that I enjoy the most. The topics we cover every week, all interesting activities, were very enjoyable. Of course, one of the biggest factors in this was our instructor, Beran hoca .</p>
