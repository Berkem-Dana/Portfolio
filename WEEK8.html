												<h3>What is IoT?</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The term "Internet of Things" (IoT) describes an enormous number of devices that gather and share data. Numerous people have been effectively connected through the Internet, but it is now time to connect actual, ordinary objects as well. Anything may be made into a linked IoT device thanks to today's modern technologies<br>
												Imagine this: You're a patient who is at risk, and thanks to modern technology, you have access to a medical bracelet that keeps track of your vital signs like heart rate and blood pressure. Your healthcare providers would be able to access the data that this bracelet would collect as well. Your doctor might immediately access information on your vital signs if they are low and make a diagnosis without you ever leaving your bed. Depending on how bad the situation is, your doctor might immediately dispatch an ambulance to take you to the hospital. As a result, situations when medical personnel arrive on the scene too late are avoided, as are visits to the clinic on a weekly or monthly basis.
                                                                                        This is only one example of how IoT might benefit billions of people.

												<h3>“What does technology mean for the city and the quality of life?” — Dr. Reichental</h3>
											</header>
											<p>There are numerous issues that everyday impact local residents, particularly in the downtown areas. These issues are only going to get worse as more and more people move into urban areas each year. What can we do to address these issues, if not completely prevent them? A potential fix is provided by IoT.<br>
											Traffic is one of the main issues that the locals face. Even though it's awful, most people have to deal with the hardship of driving downtown. But did you realize that obtaining parking is one of the main factors contributing to this never-ending backlog?<br>
											People turning around in circles in an attempt to find a parking place are the main cause of the downtown gridlock. But this issue might be easily fixed using IoT. This information can be gathered and made available to local drivers by installing proximity sensors in parking spaces all across the city. In this method, individuals would have access to real-time information letting them know where and which parking spaces are available rather than aimlessly hunting for parking spots.<br>
											All citizens' lives would be better and easier if cities were connected and data was collected. IoT has limitless potential and has great promise for the future in terms of resolving significant problems.<br>
